# WoWS-proships.ru-scraper
my first own coding exercise - started in October 2021

## Background

I attended a meeting of the Python Aberdeen User Group in October on the topic 'Automate the boring and focus
on the exciting', where Arturo Regalado talked about web scraping.

Since I used to play World of Warships and also did my first steps with coding and Python, this meeting gave me the
idea to combine the playing background with coding, and develop a web scraper for a website that contains a lot of
information about the different ships.

## What to consider

At that time I did not yet have knowledge about functions and object oriented programming. Also I had not yet been
aware of the fact, that there is an API for World of Warships.
